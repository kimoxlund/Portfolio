      Personal project born out of frustration with the current selection of
      overly complicated apps for managing a sports team.

      Sometimes you just need to know who's in or out, where the game is, and
      what time to show up. As someone who rarely gets to work with the backend
      side of JavaScript apps, I decided Firebase would be a good place to start
      learning about handling data in an app. The app is built as a progressive
      web app using Vue and Vuex. The process included quite a few a-ha moments
      and an appreciation of how intricate the relationship between back and
      front end really is.

      As a next step I'm working on porting it to React Native to become more
      familiar with that and hopefully, when it's ready, release it into the
      wild.
